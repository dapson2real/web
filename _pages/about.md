I am a research scientist looking for challenging opportunities in an academic/industrial environment. I received my Ph.D. from the [University of Calgary - Schulich School of Engineering](http://schulich.ucalgary.ca/departments/chemical-and-petroleum-engineering/), Alberta, Canada. I received my Master of Science in Petroleum Engineering at [Khalifa University](http://www.ku.ac.ae/), U.A.E and Bachelor of Technology in Chemical Engineering at [Ladoke Akintola University of Technology](http://www.lautech.edu.ng/), Nigeria. Previously, I worked as a doctoral research scientist for Computer Modelling Group Ltd, Calgary, a reservoir engineer for Abu Dhabi National Oil Company â€“ Onshore, and a research engineer for Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, U.A.E. At present, I have over 20 publications in refereed journals and conferences. I was one of the [11 recipients of the most prestigious *Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship*](http://www.ucalgary.ca/utoday/issue/2014-08-15/eleven-vanier-scholarship-recipients-announced-2014) from University of Calgary in 2017. I have also been awarded one of the most prestigious scholarships - [*Killam Doctoral Memorial Scholarship*](https://www.ucalgary.ca/killam/doctoral/predoctoral) in 2017 and 2018. I also took the first position in [SPE Canada regional student paper contest](http://www.spe.org/students/contests/winners.php) and represented Canada at the international competition in 2017. My research interests are reservoir engineering and simulation, reservoir characterization, fluid transport in porous media, enhanced/improved Oil recovery, reactive transport modeling, geochemistry and geomechanics, analytical and numerical modeling, compositional simulation, pressure transient analysis, naturally fractured reservoirs, numerical optimization, data analytics/Machine Learning, Carbon sequestration and geothermal system.
